<h4>The Ariella  A Petite Free Form Fiberglass Swimming Pool</h4>
<p>The Ariella is a petite, free-form swimming pool that fits snugly into any backyard with limited square 
  footage. We love this fiberglass swimming pool because of its relaxed features and basic layout. San Juan 
  Pools designed it to contain all of the standard elements that homeowners enjoy. From a shallow end bench, 
  tanning ledge, standard hopper (deep end) & free form layout  it includes our popular features compacted 
  into a small frame.</p>
